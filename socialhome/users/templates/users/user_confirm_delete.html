            Hey! Please note that if you <i>do</i> go ahead with this, might we say, drastic action, we will of course
            delete any content you have created on <i>this server</i>. Additionally, we will try to delete the content
            that <i>this server</i> has sent to <i>other servers</i> as requested by <i>you</i>. These servers are owned
            by other people (decentralization <3). If these other servers choose to ignore the delete request or they
            happen to have technical difficulties in deleting the content as requested by us, please contact the
            administrators of the other servers. Thanks <3
