Checklist
.........

⚠ Please review the guidelines for contributing (https://socialhome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) to this repository and then go through the following checklist.

* Make sure you are requesting to merge a non-master branch from your fork. Do not create PR's from your `master` branch!
* Does your code have unit tests? All major code paths should be tested sufficiently. See existing tests for examples.
* Did you run the whole test suite through and ensure no existing tests break?
* Please check the documentation whether your PR will require changes or additions to any documentation pages. Use proper English!
* If changing or adding UI pages or elements add screenshots to the PR.
* If the PR is not ready to be merged:

  - Prefix the PR title with "[WIP] ".
  - Add a list of TODO's that are missing from the PR to the description.

* Consider adding a changelog entry to the current unreleased version. Use proper English, reference the right issue (if any, not your PR) and make sure to add the entry to the correct section ("Added", "Changed", "Fixed" or "Removed"). If you are not sure whether you need a changelog entry - don't add one!

* Ensure commit messages are descriptive and sufficiently detailed. If possible, split the feature into smaller easier to follow commits. As a rule of thumb, small PR's and small commits are always preferred. See https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for notes on what is a good commit.

Thank you! ✌
